# LocationManager

**Location Manager** is a library that wraps and enhances iOS' built-in _CLLocationManager_.

It provides with a more flexible format for location coordinates , allows coordinate comparison and extra functionality such as finding the nearest point from a set of coordinates or getting the name of the place one is currently in.

This package has primarily been built for use in my apps but I think that much of its functionality can be of use to other developers as well.
